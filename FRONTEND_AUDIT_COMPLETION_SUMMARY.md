# Frontend Content Audit & Refactoring - COMPLETION SUMMARY

## ✅ TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

The Next.js/Sanity project has been successfully audited and refactored to ensure **all frontend content is dynamically rendered from Sanity CMS** with no hardcoded business content remaining.

## 📋 COMPLETED WORK

### 1. **About Page Transformation**

- **Before**: Hardcoded business content scattered throughout the page
- **After**: Fully CMS-driven with enhanced aboutPage schema
- **Key Changes**:
  - Created comprehensive `aboutPage` schema in Sanity (`apps/studio/schemas/aboutPage.ts`)
  - Added `getAboutPageData` fetcher function
  - Refactored page structure to match services page design
  - Migrated all hardcoded content to Sanity via migration script
  - Hero, subtitle, content sections, achievements, and badge are now CMS-controlled

### 2. **Schema & Data Structure**

- **New Schema**: `aboutPage.ts` with comprehensive fields for dynamic content
- **Migration**: Used `migrateHardcodedContent.ts` to seed Sanity with proper data
- **Fetchers**: Added `getAboutPageData` to `contentFetchers.ts`

### 3. **Content Areas Made Dynamic**

- ✅ Hero section (title, subtitle, description)
- ✅ About content sections (multiple content blocks)
- ✅ Achievements section (stats and values)
- ✅ Badge/certification section
- ✅ All text content and messaging

### 4. **Design Consistency**

- **Layout**: About page now matches services page structure
- **Styling**: Consistent hero sections, spacing, and typography
- **Components**: Leverages existing CMS-driven components

## 🔍 AUDIT RESULTS
