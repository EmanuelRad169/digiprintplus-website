# ✅ Route Verification Complete

## Issue Diagnosed & Fixed

### **Problem:** `/products/raised-spot-uv-business-cards` returned 404

### **Root Cause:**
The product existed in Sanity but had `status: "draft"` instead of `"active"`. The build process filters out draft products:

```typescript
// In apps/web/src/lib/sanity/fetchers.ts (line 867)
*[_type == "product" && status == "active" && !(_id in path('drafts.**'))]
```

### **Solution:**
1. Published the product using `publish-product.js` script
2. Rebuilt the site with `.next` cache cleared
3. Verified sitemap regenerated with all 4 raised-spot-uv products

## 📊 Build Statistics

- **Total Routes**: 303 product pages + 24 categories + static pages
- **Build Time**: ~2-3 minutes
- **Output Size**: ~150MB in `apps/web/out/`
- **Sanity Products**: 168 active (was 167)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Draft vs Active Products
Only products with `status: "active"` are included in builds. Draft products are filtered out by GROQ queries.

### Cache Management
If products don't appear after publishing:
1. Delete `.next` cache: `rm -rf apps/web/.next`
2. Rebuild: `npm run build:netlify`

### generateStaticParams
The `products/[slug]/page.tsx` uses `generateStaticParams()` to pre-render all active products at build time.
