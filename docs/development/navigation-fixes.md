# Navigation and Routing Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

When navigating to URLs like `/business-cards` or `/flyers-brochures` from the navbar, users were not seeing the inner product pages like `/products/tri-fold-brochures`. The issue was caused by:

1. **Legacy page conflicts**: There were old Sanity page documents with slugs like "business-cards" and "flyers-brochures" that were interfering with the new category-based routing structure.

2. **Incorrect footer links**: The default footer data was linking to `/products/business-cards` instead of `/products/category/business-cards`.

3. **Incomplete navigation menu**: The fallback navigation didn't include proper category links.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Footer Links ✅

**File**: `/apps/web/lib/sanity/footer.ts`

Updated the `DEFAULT_FOOTER` services to use the correct category URLs:

```typescript
services: [
  { label: 'Business Cards', slug: '/products/category/business-cards' },
  { label: 'Brochures', slug: '/products/category/brochures' },
  { label: 'Banners', slug: '/products/category/banners' },
  { label: 'Flyers', slug: '/products/category/flyers' },
  { label: 'Posters', slug: '/products/category/posters' },
  { label: 'Stickers', slug: '/products/category/stickers' }
],
```

### 2. Enhanced Navigation Menu ✅

**File**: `/apps/web/components/navigation.tsx`

Updated the fallback navigation to include a proper product mega menu:

```typescript
megaMenu: [
  {
    sectionTitle: 'Product Categories',
    links: [
      { name: 'All Products', href: '/products', description: 'Browse our full catalog' },
      {
        name: 'Business Cards',
        href: '/products/category/business-cards',
        description: 'Professional business cards',
      },
      {
        name: 'Flyers & Brochures',
        href: '/products/category/flyers-brochures',
        description: 'Marketing materials',
      },
      {
        name: 'Postcards',
        href: '/products/category/postcards',
        description: 'Direct mail postcards',
      },
      { name: 'Banners', href: '/products/category/banners', description: 'Large format banners' },
      { name: 'Booklets', href: '/products/category/booklets', description: 'Multi-page booklets' },
      { name: 'Catalogs', href: '/products/category/catalogs', description: 'Product catalogs' },
    ],
  },
];
```

### 3. Added Middleware for Legacy Route Redirects ✅

**File**: `/apps/web/middleware.ts` (New)

Created a middleware to automatically redirect legacy category routes to the new structure:

```typescript
const CATEGORY_REDIRECTS: Record<string, string> = {
  '/business-cards': '/products/category/business-cards',
  '/flyers-brochures': '/products/category/flyers-brochures',
  '/postcards': '/products/category/postcards',
  '/banners': '/products/category/banners',
  // ... and more
};
```

This ensures that:

- `/business-cards` → redirects to `/products/category/business-cards`
- `/flyers-brochures` → redirects to `/products/category/flyers-brochures`
- And so on for all category routes

## Current URL Structure ✅

The routing structure is now properly organized:

### Category Pages

- `/products` - All products page with category navigation
- `/products/category/business-cards` - Business cards category page
- `/products/category/flyers-brochures` - Flyers & brochures category page
- `/products/category/postcards` - Postcards category page
- And so on for all 15 product categories

### Individual Product Pages

- `/products/tri-fold-brochures` - Individual product page
- `/products/premium-business-cards` - Individual product page
- `/products/standard-postcards` - Individual product page
- And so on for all products

## Verification ✅

1. **Build successful**: The Next.js build completes without errors and generates all category pages
2. **Routes accessible**: All category and product pages are accessible at their correct URLs
3. **Navigation working**: The navigation menu now includes proper category links
4. **Footer fixed**: Footer services link to category pages instead of legacy routes
5. **Redirects active**: Legacy routes automatically redirect to the new category structure

## Next Steps

### For Users

- Navigate to http://localhost:3000/products to see all products with category navigation
- Use the navigation menu "Products" dropdown to access specific categories
- Individual products are accessible at `/products/[product-slug]`

### For Development

- **Legacy page cleanup**: Consider removing or updating the legacy page documents in Sanity that have conflicting slugs
- **Navigation data**: Optionally create proper navigation documents in Sanity to replace the fallback navigation
- **Category completion**: Complete the manual creation of missing categories in Sanity Studio as outlined in `CATEGORY_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

## Technical Details

The fix addresses the root cause by ensuring the routing hierarchy is:

1. **Categories**: `/products/category/[category-slug]`
2. **Products**: `/products/[product-slug]`
3. **Legacy routes**: Automatically redirect to category pages

This prevents conflicts between category pages and individual product pages while maintaining SEO-friendly URLs and proper navigation structure.
