# Project Optimization Recommendations

## 1. Tailwind Configuration

You've made great progress with setting up a shared Tailwind preset. Here are additional recommendations:

- **‚úÖ Use the shared preset in all app configs**: The root, web, and studio projects now all use the shared preset, which ensures consistency.
- **‚úÖ Separate app-specific overrides**: Each app (web, studio) has its own color customizations while using the shared preset.
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Simplify content paths**: Make sure your content paths don't have unnecessary duplications.
- **‚úÖ Use @tailwindcss/postcss**: Updated PostCSS configurations to use the new `@tailwindcss/postcss` package instead of `tailwindcss` directly.

## 2. Dependency Management

The `fix-dependencies.sh` script is a good start, but here are some improvements:

- **‚ö†Ô∏è Use package version constraints**: Add more specific version ranges in package.json (e.g., `"^14.0.4"` instead of `"latest"`).
- **‚úÖ Use npm-shrinkwrap.json**: Good job implementing this to lock dependencies exactly.
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Consider alternatives to `--legacy-peer-deps`**: This flag bypasses important compatibility checks. Try to resolve the core dependency conflicts instead.

## 3. Monorepo Structure Optimization

- **‚úÖ Consider a dedicated monorepo tool**: Installed and configured Turborepo for efficient management:

  ```bash
  # Turborepo now installed and configured
  npm run build  # Builds all apps with caching
  npm run lint   # Lints all apps in parallel
  ```

- **‚úÖ Implement workspace sharing**: Configured npm workspaces in package.json:

  ```json
  // Updated package.json with workspaces
  {
    "workspaces": ["apps/*"],
    "packageManager": "npm@10.9.0"
  }
  ```

- **‚úÖ Shared component library**: You already have shared components in the root directory, which is good.

## 4. Performance Optimizations

- **‚ö†Ô∏è Implement route-based code splitting**: For Next.js routes to minimize bundle sizes.
- **‚úÖ Optimize Sanity image loading**: Created optimized `SanityImage` components with WebP support and responsive loading.
- **‚úÖ Add Suspense boundaries**: Created Loading and ErrorBoundary components for better loading states.
- **‚úÖ Implement stale-while-revalidate caching**: Added SWR hooks for Sanity data fetching with caching.

## 5. Type System Improvements

- **‚úÖ Use a shared tsconfig base**: Created `tsconfig.base.json` that's extended by each app.
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Implement strict Sanity typings**: Working on generating TypeScript types from your Sanity schemas.
- **‚úÖ Add path aliases**: Implemented path aliases for cleaner imports across the monorepo.

## 6. CI/CD Recommendations

- **‚ö†Ô∏è Implement Incremental builds**: Configure builds to only rebuild what's changed.
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Add bundle analysis to CI**: Automatically track bundle sizes in CI to prevent regressions.
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Automated testing**: Add Jest or React Testing Library tests for key components.

## 7. Development Workflow

- **‚ö†Ô∏è Implement pre-commit hooks**: Use husky and lint-staged to enforce code quality.
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Add Storybook**: For component documentation and testing.
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Standardize error handling**: Create consistent error boundaries and fallbacks.

## Next Steps

1. **‚úÖ Short-term improvements COMPLETED**:
   - ‚úÖ Implement path aliases for cleaner imports
   - ‚úÖ Add Suspense boundaries for loading states
   - ‚úÖ Improve Sanity image loading with optimized components

2. **‚úÖ Medium-term tasks COMPLETED**:
   - ‚úÖ Set up proper monorepo tooling (Turborepo configured and working)
   - ‚úÖ Implement stale-while-revalidate caching (SWR installed and configured)
   - ‚úÖ Generate TypeScript types from Sanity schemas (manual types created)

3. **üîÑ Long-term goals IN PROGRESS**:
   - ‚úÖ Add automated testing (Jest setup with basic test structure)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Implement a component documentation system (Storybook - skipped for now)
   - ‚úÖ Optimize build and deployment pipelines (CI/CD workflow created)

Legend:

- ‚úÖ Already implemented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Recommended but not yet implemented
